# UNIT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Similarities

1. JS and Ruby both make it easier for developers to write code
2. JS and Ruby both use inheritances
3. JS and Ruby have libraries

Differences

1. JS creates a dynamic user interface and Ruby powers web apps
2. JS is used in the web brower and Ruby is used on the server 
3. JS has supports OOP and functional programming and Ruby is experessive

Researched answer:

Commonalities:

Object-Oriented:

Both JavaScript and Ruby are object-oriented languages, which means they use objects as the basic building blocks of code. This allows for the creation of modular and reusable code through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Dynamic Typing:

Both languages are dynamically typed, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime rather than being explicitly declared. This provides flexibility but can also lead to runtime errors if not carefully managed.
Interpreted Languages:

JavaScript and Ruby are both interpreted languages, meaning that their code is executed directly by an interpreter without the need for compilation. This allows for quick development cycles and easier debugging.
Differences:

Use Cases:

JavaScript is primarily used for front-end web development, enabling dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It is the scripting language of choice for web browsers. Ruby, on the other hand, is often used for backend web development, with frameworks like Ruby on Rails facilitating the creation of web applications.
Syntax:

The syntax of JavaScript and Ruby differs significantly. For example, JavaScript uses curly braces {} to define blocks of code and has a C-style syntax, while Ruby uses keywords and indentation to define code blocks. Additionally, Ruby emphasizes readability and developer happiness, aiming for a more natural language-like syntax.
Concurrency Model:

JavaScript is single-threaded with an event-driven concurrency model, using mechanisms like callbacks and Promises to handle asynchronous operations. On the other hand, Ruby traditionally has a multi-threaded model with threads for concurrency. However, it's important to note that Ruby 3 introduced the Fiber scheduler, allowing for lightweight concurrent programming similar to JavaScript's asynchronous model.

2. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: TDD means following a process where you write the test, fail, code again, rerun test to pass, and do it all over again. 

Researched answer: TDD, or Test-Driven Development, is a software development methodology where developers write tests before writing the actual code.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: Putting statements together and passing them as a argument to a method 

Researched answer: In Ruby, a block is a piece of code that can be passed to a method for execution. 

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?
